## Lab Title
Introduction to Design Thinking: Empathy Mapping Exercise

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to understand and apply the principles of empathy mapping as the first stage of the design thinking process. We aimed to create a comprehensive empathy map for a hypothetical user persona to better understand their needs, motivations, and pain points.

## Introduction
Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that emphasizes empathy, ideation, and experimentation. In this first lab, we focused on the "Empathize" stage by creating an empathy map for a college student struggling with time management. This exercise helps designers step into the users' shoes and understand their experiences from their perspective.

## Methodology
1. **User Research**: Conducted preliminary research through:
   - Online surveys (10 participants)
   - Informal interviews with 3 college students
   - Observation of study habits in the library

2. **Empathy Map Creation**:
   - Divided the map into four quadrants: Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels
   - Collected data points from research and organized them into respective quadrants
   - Identified patterns and insights

3. **Tools Used**:
   - Miro board for digital collaboration
   - Post-it notes for initial brainstorming
   - Interview recording and transcription tools

## Key Findings/Results
**Says Quadrant:**
- "I never have enough time to complete everything"
- "I wish I could balance academics and social life better"
- "I feel overwhelmed during exam weeks"

**Thinks Quadrant:**
- Worries about future career prospects
- Questions the effectiveness of current study methods
- Believes others are managing better than them

**Does Quadrant:**
- Checks phone frequently during study sessions
- Stays up late to finish assignments
- Skips meals when busy

**Feels Quadrant:**
- Stressed about deadlines
- Anxious about academic performance
- Frustrated with lack of control over schedule

**Key Insights:**
- Students express time management issues verbally but their actions (phone checking, late nights) contribute to the problem
- There's a disconnect between what students think others do and reality
- Emotional stress is a significant barrier to productivity

## Discussion
The empathy mapping exercise revealed several important insights about our target user persona. The most striking finding was the gap between what students say and what they actually do. While they express a desire for better time management, their habitual behaviors (such as frequent phone checking) work against this goal.

This suggests that any design solution should address not just time management tools but also habit formation and distraction management. The emotional aspect (stress, anxiety) also needs to be considered, as it appears to be both a cause and effect of poor time management.

The methodology proved effective, though we could have benefited from a larger sample size for more diverse perspectives. Future iterations should include students from different academic disciplines and year levels.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Recruitment Challenge**: Finding students willing to participate in interviews during exam season was difficult. We overcame this by offering coffee vouchers as incentives.

2. **Data Organization**: Initially, we had overlapping categories between quadrants. We resolved this by establishing clear criteria for each quadrant and reorganizing the data.

3. **Bias Awareness**: As students ourselves, we had to be careful not to project our own experiences. We addressed this through peer review and validation with our instructor.

## Conclusion
This lab successfully introduced us to empathy mapping as a fundamental tool in design thinking. We learned that truly understanding users requires going beyond surface-level observations to uncover the complex relationships between what people say, think, do, and feel.

The insights gained from this exercise will inform the next stages of the design thinking process as we move into defining problems and ideating solutions. The key takeaway is that effective design must address both practical needs (time management tools) and emotional needs (reducing stress and anxiety).

This experience has strengthened our understanding of human-centered design and the importance of empathy in creating meaningful solutions.
